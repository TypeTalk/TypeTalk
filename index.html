		</h3>

		<p>TypeTalk is a Text to Speech frontend aimed at people with
			speech problems. TypeTalk uses MaryTTS in the background and includes
			several voices. At this moment only English voices are included.</p>

		</h3>

		<p>
			TypeTalk is written in Java. You need a Java Runtime Environment to
			run TypeTalk. You can run TypeTalk with either <a
				href="http://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK</a> or <a
				href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Oracle
				JDK</a>.
		<p>TypeTalk has two areas for typing. A single-row bottom text
			field to let you enter text. When TypeTalk pops up this text field
			grabs the focus and you can start typing. When you hit the enter key
			the text is moved to the top text area and TypeTalk speaks the words
			you typed. This way of using TypeTalk is similar to using a messaging
			program.</p>

		<p>The top text area is meant for larger portions of text. When
			you hit the 'play' button on the bottom right the text is spoken to
			you. With the 'save' button you can save the output to a wave file.
			When TypeTalk encounters a word that the MaryTTS back-end cannot
			pronounce it shows a little popup at the top-right corner of your
			screen with the unpronounceable word. You can correct the text in the
			top text area to enable a complete message.</p>

		<p>TypeTalk can be started with a minimized window in order to let
			you load it at login and have it waiting for you when you need it.
			With a keyboard shortcut TypeTalk will be at your service.</p>

			<a id="configure-the-included-voices" class="anchor"
				href="#configure-the-included-voices" aria-hidden="true"><span
				aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configure the
			included voices
		</h3>

		<p>You can configure the voices by clicking 'Configure' -
			&gt;'Configure voice'. All configuration options in the dialog show a
			little help button with a explanation about the effect. You can
			listen to the effect through a text field and play button at the
			bottom of the dialog.</p>

		<h3>
			<a id="configure-the-interface" class="anchor"
				href="#configure-the-interface" aria-hidden="true"><span
				aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configure the
			interface
		</h3>

		<p>You can configure the behaviour of TypeTalk by clicking
			'Configure' -&gt; 'Configure graphical interface'. Through this
			dialog you can disable the splashscreen, the welcome screen at
			startup and whether TypeTalk should be started minimized or not. In
			this dialog you can also change the keyboard shortcut for toggling
			the visibility of the ui.</p>
