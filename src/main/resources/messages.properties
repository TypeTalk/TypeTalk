tract_scaler = Vocal Tract Linear Scaling
tract_scaler_help = Vocal Tract Linear Scaling Effect:\nCreates a shortened or lengthened vocal tract effect by shifting the formants.\nParameter:\n   <amount>   Definition : The amount of formant shifting\n   Range      : [0.25,4.0]\n   For values of <amount> less than 1.0, the formants are shifted to lower frequencies\n     resulting in a longer vocal tract (i.e. a deeper voice).\n   Values greater than 1.0 shift the formants to higher frequencies.\n     The result is a shorter vocal tract.
jet_pilot = Jet Pilot
jet_pilot_help = Jet pilot effect:\nFilters the input signal using an FIR bandpass filter.\nParameters: NONE
f0_scaling = F0 scaling
f0_scaling_help = F0 scaling effect for HMM voices:\nAll voiced f0 values are multiplied by <f0Scale> for HMM voices.\nThis operation effectively scales the range of f0 values.\nNote that mean f0 is preserved during the operation.\nParameter:\n   <f0Scale>   Definition : Scale ratio for modifying the dynamic range of the f0 contour\n                If f0Scale>1.0, the range is expanded (i.e. voice with more variable pitch)\n                If f0Scale<1.0, the range is compressed (i.e. more monotonic voice)\n                If f0Scale=1.0 results in no changes in range\n   Range      : [0.0,3.0]\nExample:\nf0Scale:2.0;
f0_add = F0 mean shifting
f0_add_help = F0 mean shifting effect for HMM voices:\nShifts the mean F0 value by <f0Add> Hz for HMM voices.\nParameter:\n   <f0Add>   Definition : F0 shift of mean value in Hz for synthesized speech output\n   Range      : [-300.0,300.0]\nExample:\nf0Add:50.0;
rate = Rate
rate_help = Duration scaling for HMM voices:\nScales the HMM output speech duration by <durScale>.\nParameter:\n   <durScale>   Definition : Duration scaling factor for synthesized speech output\n   Range      : [0.1,3.0]\nExample:\ndurScale:1.5;
robot = Robot
robot_help = Robotiser Effect:\nCreates a robotic voice by setting all phases to zero.\nParameter:\n   <amount>   Definition : The amount of robotic voice at the output\n   Range      : [0.0,100.0]\nExample:\namount:100.0;
whisper = Whisper
whisper_help = Whisper Effect:\nCreates a whispered voice by replacing the LPC residual with white noise.\nParameter:\n   <amount>   Definition : The amount of whisperised voice at the output\n   Range      : [0.0,100.0]\nExample:\namount:100.0;
stadium = Stadium
stadium_help = Stadium Effect:\nAdds stadium effect by applying a specially designed multi-tap chorus.\nParameter:\n   <amount>   Definition : The amount of stadium effect at the output\n   Range      : [0.0,200.0]\nExample:\namount:100.0
chorus = Chorus 
chorus_help = Multi-Tap Chorus Effect:\nAdds chorus effect by summing up the original signal with delayed and amplitude scaled versions.\nThe parameters should consist of delay and amplitude pairs for each tap.\nA variable number of taps (max 20) can be specified by simply defining more delay-amplitude pairs.\nEach tap outputs a delayed and gain-scaled version of the original signal.\nAll tap outputs are summed up with the oiginal signal with appropriate gain normalization.\nParameters:\n   <delay1>\n   Definition : The amount of delay in miliseconds for tap #1\n   Range      : [0,5000]\n   <amp1>\n   Definition : Relative amplitude of the channel gain as compared to original signal gain for tap #1\n   Range      : [-5.0,5.0]\n   <delay2>\n   Definition : The amount of delay in miliseconds in delayed channel #2\n   Range      : [0,5000]\n   <amp2>\n   Definition : Relative amplitude of the channel gain as compared to original signal gain for delayed channel #2\n   Range      : [-5.0,5.0]\n   ...\n   <delayN>\n   Definition : The amount of delay in miliseconds in delayed channel #N\n   Range      : [0,5000]\n   <ampN>\n   Definition : Relative amplitude of the channel gain as compared to original signal gain for delayed channel #N\n   Range      : [-5.0,5.0]\n   Note: Maximum possible number of taps is N=20. Parameters for more taps will simply be neglected.\nExample: (A three-tap chorus effect)\ndelay1:466;amp1:0.54;delay2:600;amp2:-0.10;delay3:250;amp3:0.30
fir_filter = FIR filter
fir_filter_help = FIR filtering:\nFilters the input signal by an FIR filter.\nParameters:\n   <type>\n   Definition : Type of filter (1:Lowpass, 2:Highpass, 3:Bandpass, 4:Bandreject)\n   Range      : {1,2,3,4}\n   <fc>   Definition : Cutoff frequency in Hz for lowpass and highpass filters\n   Range      : [0.0, fs/2.0] where fs is the sampling rate in Hz\n   <fc1>   Definition : Lower frequency cutoff in Hz for bandpass and bandreject filters\n   Range      : [0.0, fs/2.0] where fs is the sampling rate in Hz\n   <fc2>   Definition : Higher frequency cutoff in Hz for bandpass and bandreject filters\n   Range      : [0.0, fs/2.0] where fs is the sampling rate in Hz\nExample: (A band-pass filter)\ntype:3;fc1:500.0;fc2:2000.0
