chorus = Chorus 
chorus_help = Multi-Tap Chorus Effect:\nAdds chorus effect by summing up the original signal with delayed and amplitude scaled versions.\nThe parameters should consist of delay and amplitude pairs for each tap.\nA variable number of taps (max 20) can be specified by simply defining more delay-amplitude pairs.\nEach tap outputs a delayed and gain-scaled version of the original signal.\nAll tap outputs are summed up with the oiginal signal with appropriate gain normalization.\nParameters:\n   <delay1>\n   Definition : The amount of delay in miliseconds for tap #1\n   Range      : [0,5000]\n   <amp1>\n   Definition : Relative amplitude of the channel gain as compared to original signal gain for tap #1\n   Range      : [-5.0,5.0]\n   <delay2>\n   Definition : The amount of delay in miliseconds in delayed channel #2\n   Range      : [0,5000]\n   <amp2>\n   Definition : Relative amplitude of the channel gain as compared to original signal gain for delayed channel #2\n   Range      : [-5.0,5.0]\n   ...\n   <delayN>\n   Definition : The amount of delay in miliseconds in delayed channel #N\n   Range      : [0,5000]\n   <ampN>\n   Definition : Relative amplitude of the channel gain as compared to original signal gain for delayed channel #N\n   Range      : [-5.0,5.0]\n   Note: Maximum possible number of taps is N=20.
