			<a name="summary">Summary</a>
		</h3>
		TypeTalk provides easy access to MaryTTS. It includes the MaryTTS
		backend and several voices. At this moment only English voices are
		included. TypeTalk can be started with a minimized window in order to
		let you load it at login.
		</p>

		<p>
		<h3>
			<a name="ui">Using the UI</a>
		</h3>
		In its default state the TypeTalk window only shows a single text
		field and you can start typing right away. When hitting 'Enter'
		TypeTalk will 'speak' the typed sentence. This way of using TypeTalk
		is similar to using a messaging program.
		</p>

		<p>The TypeTalk window can be expanded using the expand button. In
			this mode TypeTalk has two areas for typing. The single-row text
			field to enter text and a text area on top that is meant for larger
			portions of text. When you hit the 'play' button on the bottom right
			the text is spoken to you. With the 'save' button you can save the
			output to a wave file. When TypeTalk encounters a word that the
			MaryTTS backend cannot pronounce it shows a little popup at the
			top-right corner of your screen with the unpronouncable word. You can
			correct your text in the top text area to enable TypeTalk saving the
			complete message. A couple of commonly used phrases are ready at the
			9 buttons below the text area.</p>

		<p>
		<h3>
			<a name="configv">Configure voice</a>
		</h3>
		You can configure the by clicking <i>'Configure' - >'Configure
			voice'</i>. All configuration options in the dialog show a little help
		button with a explanation about the effect. You can listen to the
		effect through a textfield and play button at the bottom of the
		dialog.
		</p>

		<p>
		<h3>
			<a name="configui">Configure the UI</a>
		</h3>
		You can configure the behavior of the ui by clicking <i>'Configure'
			-> 'Configure graphical interface'</i>. Through this dialog you can
		disable the splashscreen, the welcome screen at startup and whether
		the ui should be started minimized or not. In this dialog you can also
		change the keyboard shortcut for toggling the visibility of the ui.
		</p>

		<p>
		<h3>
			<a name="configcp">Configure common phrases</a>
		</h3>
		You can configure the phrases spoken when clicking the 9 buttons below
		the text area by clicking <i>'Configure' -> 'Configure common
			phrases'</i>. Through this dialog you can set a often used phrase at one
		of the 9 buttons.
		</p>

		<p>
		<h3>
			<a name="keyboard">Using your keyboard</a>
		</h3>
		Great care is taken that you do not have to switch between your mouse
		and your keyboard. Every button has its own keyboard shortcut. These
		are displayed by hovering over them. The menu items are accessible by
		pressing 'ALT' and the underlined letter. You can shift focus using
		the 'TAB' key and the 'SHIFT TAB' key combination.
