<h3><a name="summary">Summary</a></h3>
TypeTalk provides easy access to MaryTTS. It includes the MaryTTS backend and several voices. At this moment only English voices are included.
TypeTalk can be started with a minimized window in order to let you load it at login. 
</p>

<p>
<h3><a name="ui">Using the UI</a></h3>
TypeTalk has two areas for typing. A single-row bottom textfield to let you enter text. When the ui pops up this textfield grabs the focus and
you can start typing. When you hit the enter key the text is moved to the top textarea and TypeTalk speeks the words you typed. This way of using
the ui is similar to using a messaging ui. 
</p>

<p>
The top textarea is meant for larger portions of text. When you hit the 'play' button on the bottom right the text is spoken to you. With the 'save'
button you can save the output to a wave file. When TypeTalk encounters a word that the MaryTTS backend cannot pronounce it shows a little popup
at the top-right corner of your screen with the unpronouncable word. You can correct the text in the top textarea to enable a complete message.    
</p>

<p>
<h3><a name="configv">Configure voice</a></h3> 
You can configure the by clicking <i>'Configure' - >'Configure voice'</i>. All configuration options in the dialog show a little help button with a explanation
about the effect. You can listen to the effect through a textfield and play button at the bottom of the dialog.
</p>

<p>
<h3><a name="configui">Configure the UI</a></h3> 
You can configure the behavior of the ui by clicking <i>'Configure' -> 'Configure graphical interface'</i>. Through this dialog you can disable the splashscreen,
the welcome screen at startup and whether the ui should be started minimized or not. In this dialog you can also change the keyboard shortcut for
toggling the visibility of the ui.
